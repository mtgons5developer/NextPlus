# NextPlus
NextPlus App and Bluestack Emulator Number Automated Registration, Pixel Recognition.

If you have plans on using this for NextPlus I would suggest to use your own database, I used a clients web based DB inputs so I had to automate it from a browser.

You'll need BlueStacks Tweaker 3.12 and Bluestacks version 1+. This will not run on the latest Bluestacks.
